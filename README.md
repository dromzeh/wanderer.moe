**A (pretty) useful website/database for Genshin Impact assets.**
- Repository for character 'parts': https://github.com/dromzeh/genshin-character-parts
- Repository for character splash art: https://github.com/dromzeh/genshin-splash-art

## Running the Website

In Development:
```bash
  pnpm dev
```

In Production:
```bash
  pnpm build
```

Netlify used to be used for hosting the site, but cloudflare pages is used instead. You can view `netlify.toml` in the root of the repository to see the old netlify configuration which is similar to how it is hosted on pages.
